## Frontend

This repository contains the frontend project: üìÅ [Renda Zhang WEB](https://github.com/RendaZhang/rendazhang)

### Architecture Overview

#### BaseLayout Component Design Notes

`src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` serves as the global page framework for the site, responsible for setting `<head>` metadata, SEO tags, and root-level slots. The navigation bar and hamburger menu now render on the server and hydrate with `client:load`, avoiding language flicker while preserving interactivity. The primary reasons for keeping this file as an Astro component are as follows:

- **Static Content Does Not Require JavaScript**: The layout structure and metadata generation are purely static content. Astro can directly output HTML without introducing the React runtime.
- **Maintain Partial Hydration Benefits**: Only interactive regions such as the navigation bar and hamburger menu use React, rendering static HTML first and hydrating on the client via `client:load`. The rest of the layout remains zero-JS, keeping bundle size minimal. Rewriting the entire layout in React would introduce additional script and hydration overhead.
- **Leverage Astro Features**: Astro-specific syntax such as `<slot>` and `is:inline` is extensively used in the layout. Migrating to React would require additional encapsulation or plugin support, increasing maintenance costs.

Consider rewriting `BaseLayout.astro` only if there are plans to fully migrate the site to React or if there is a need to share complex React state/context at the layout level. For now, maintaining the Astro version is more concise and efficient.

To satisfy Nginx CSP restrictions and allow static pages like 404/500 to reuse theme and language logic, the former inline initialization script has been moved to a blocking external script `/js/base-layout-init.js`. The file is generated from `src/scripts/base-layout-init.ts` and passes storage keys via `data-theme-key` and `data-lang-key` attributes so that theme and language are applied before the page renders.

### Local Development & Preview

1. Install dependencies and enable pre-commit:

   ```bash
   npm install
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

2. Start local dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build and preview production version:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

4. To connect to a custom backend API, set the `PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` in the root directory's `.env` / `.env.local` file:

   ```bash
   PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
   ```

5. Sentry integration also requires:

   ```bash
   SENTRY_DSN=<server dsn>
   PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=<browser dsn>
   SENTRY_PROJECT=<your project>
   SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=<auth token>
   ```

   When running local checks or pre-commit without Sentry, prepend:

   ```bash
   SKIP_SENTRY=true pre-commit run --all-files
   SKIP_SENTRY=true npm run astro -- check --incremental
   ```

   To temporarily skip ESLint checks and speed up commits, use:

   ```bash
   SKIP_ESLINT=true pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

6. Environment Variables Explanation

   Local configurations can be set in `.env` or `.env.local`, and read via the `getEnv()` function in `src/utils/env.ts`:

   ```sh
   # Public Information
   PUBLIC_SITE_BASE_URL = "https://www.rendazhang.com"
   PUBLIC_CDN_BASE="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rendazhang/rendazhang@1.0.1/"
   PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="/cloudchat"
   PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN="https://e184a284f1b7342d197ee0a0151f8353@o4509770577543168.ingest.us.sentry.io/4509770780377088"
   PUBLIC_TAG_NAME="v1.0.1"
   NODE_ENV="production"
   PUBLIC_NODE_ENV="development" # Override to "development" for local debugging
   SKIP_SENTRY="true" # Skip Sentry
   SKIP_ESLINT="true" # Skip ESLint checks

   # Sensitive configurations (example values below)
   SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN="sntrys_xxx"
   SENTRY_DSN="https://private-key@xxx.ingest.us.sentry.io/xxx"
   SENTRY_PROJECT="xxx"
   SENTRY_ORG="xxx"
   ```

After running `npm run build`, the `dist/_astro` directory will contain fingerprinted files with hash suffixes, allowing browsers to cache them long-term.

Access via `http://localhost:4321`.

Verify builds using `npm run preview`.

#### GitHub Actions

Pushing to `master` triggers GitHub Actions Auto-Deployment:

1. Code checkout & dependency installation
2. `npm run build` generates static files
3. `appleboy/scp-action` deploys `dist/` to server (e.g., `/var/www/html`)
4. Nginx serves content post-deployment

Configure server IP, SSH user, and private key in Repository Secrets. Details: üìÑ [GitHub Actions Setup](https://github.com/RendaZhang/rendazhang/blob/master/docs/guides/NATIVE_TO_ASTRO_REACT_UPGRADE.md#%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE-github-actions)

    style E fill:#f99,stroke:#333
```

#### Page Content

- `index.astro`: A multi-section homepage containing modules such as "Hero", "About Me", "Education", "Blog", "Skills & Abilities", "Experience", and "Contact Me", with a default floating `ChatWidget` badge.
- `certifications.astro`: Grid-based certification cards with Credly verification
- `deepseek_chat.astro`: A conversational interface consisting of a chat history area and an input box, supporting streaming output and real-time rendering of AI-generated Markdown content. It provides a one-click copy feature for the original content and automatically retains the chat history upon page refresh, and loads both `github-code-highlight.css` and `github-markdown-light.css` for consistent GitHub-style code highlighting. The chat UI has been refactored into reusable components such as `ChatMessageList` and `ChatInput` for better maintainability.
- `docs.astro`: Technical documentation page that loads both `github-code-highlight.css` and `github-markdown-light.css` together with highlight.js for GitHub-style Markdown layout and code highlighting.
- `login.astro`: Login form page.
- `register.astro`: Register form page.
- `404.astro/500.astro`: Custom error pages designed to handle Page Not Found (404) and Internal Server Error (500) scenarios. These pages provide clear error messages, user-friendly guidance, and a link to return to the homepage, enhancing the overall user experience.

#### Page Optimization

**Adaptive Layout**: Optimizes the display effect of the page on different devices, reduces unnecessary resource loading and layout calculations, and thereby improves performance. Ensures that the page displays well on various screen sizes (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile), enhancing user experience.

**Lazy Loading**: All images have lazy loading enabled with a loading animation. For high-definition images, LQIP (Low-Quality Image Placeholder) lazy loading optimization is applied (e.g., the Hero section on the homepage).

#### Color Scheme

The core colors of the project are designed using OKLCH design tokens and provide sRGB fallback through `color-mix` to ensure perceptual consistency across light and dark modes.

For detailed information, refer to the documentation: üìÑ [Color Scheme](https://github.com/RendaZhang/rendazhang/blob/master/docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md#%E9%85%8D%E8%89%B2%E6%96%B9%E6%A1%88).
