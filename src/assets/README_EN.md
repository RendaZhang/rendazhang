## Frontend

This repository contains the frontend project: üìÅ [Renda Zhang WEB](https://github.com/RendaZhang/rendazhang)

### Local Development & Preview

1. Install dependencies and enable pre-commit:

   ```bash
   npm install
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

2. Start local dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build and preview production version:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

4. To point the frontend at a custom backend, create a `.env` file and set `PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`:

   ```bash
   PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
   ```

   Sentry integration also requires:

   ```bash
   SENTRY_DSN=<server dsn>
   PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=<browser dsn>
   SENTRY_PROJECT=<your project>
   SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=<auth token>
   ```

After running `npm run build`, the `dist/_astro` directory will contain fingerprinted files with hash suffixes, allowing browsers to cache them long-term.

Access via `http://localhost:4321`.

Verify builds using `npm run preview`.

#### GitHub Actions

Pushing to `master` triggers GitHub Actions Auto-Deployment:

1. Code checkout & dependency installation
2. `npm run build` generates static files
3. `appleboy/scp-action` deploys `dist/` to server (e.g., `/var/www/html`)
4. Nginx serves content post-deployment

Configure server IP, SSH user, and private key in Repository Secrets. Details: üìÑ [GitHub Actions Setup](https://github.com/RendaZhang/rendazhang/blob/master/docs/NATIVE_TO_ASTRO_REACT_UPGRADE.md#%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE-github-actions)

    E -->|Home Button| A

    style A fill:#9f9,stroke:#333
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style C fill:#ff9,stroke:#333
    style D fill:#99f,stroke:#333
    style E fill:#f99,stroke:#333
```

#### Page Content

- `index.astro`: A multi-section homepage containing modules such as "Hero", "About Me", "Education", "Blog", "Skills & Abilities", "Experience", and "Contact Me", with a default floating `ChatWidget` badge.
- `certifications.astro`: Grid-based certification cards with Credly verification
- `deepseek_chat.astro`: A conversational interface consisting of a chat history area and an input box, supporting streaming output and real-time rendering of AI-generated Markdown content. It provides a one-click copy feature for the original content and automatically retains the chat history upon page refresh, and loads both `github.min.css` and `github-markdown-light.min.css` for consistent GitHub-style code highlighting. The chat UI has been refactored into reusable components such as `ChatMessageList` and `ChatInput` for better maintainability.
- `docs.astro`: Technical documentation page that loads both `github.min.css` and `github-markdown-light.min.css` together with highlight.js for GitHub-style Markdown layout and code highlighting.
- `login.astro`: Login form page.
- `register.astro`: Register form page.
- `404.html/50x.html`: Custom error pages designed to handle Page Not Found (404) and Internal Server Error (50x) scenarios. These pages provide clear error messages, user-friendly guidance, and a link to return to the homepage, enhancing the overall user experience.

#### Page Optimization

**Adaptive Layout**: Optimizes the display effect of the page on different devices, reduces unnecessary resource loading and layout calculations, and thereby improves performance. Ensures that the page displays well on various screen sizes (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile), enhancing user experience.

**Lazy Loading**: All images have lazy loading enabled with a loading animation. For high-definition images, LQIP (Low-Quality Image Placeholder) lazy loading optimization is applied (e.g., the Hero section on the homepage).

#### Color Scheme

**Unified Management**:

- Browser controls adapt to the theme (`color-scheme`).
- Public component styles are uniformly managed by `theme.css`.
- Markdown dark mode and error pages also have independent color tokens, which can be maintained in `src/styles/core/_colors.css`.
- Overlay and shadow-related colors are also set via `--color-black-rgb` and `--color-white-rgb` tokens, facilitating transparency adjustments and theme switching.
- Error page gradients also rely on these tokens, defined uniformly in `src/styles/core/_gradients.css`.

**Style Architecture Layering**:

- `src/styles/core/`: Defines foundational design tokens, including variables for colors, spacing, gradients, etc.
- `src/styles/components/`: Component-level styles (e.g., `about.css`, `chat_widget.css`, etc.).
- `src/styles/utilities/`: Layout and general utility classes, including `.debug` for debugging outlines.
- `src/styles/theme.css`: The entry point for styles, automatically importing `core/` and `utilities/`.

**Variable Dependency Diagram**:

| Accent + Dark Gray | 5.1 : 1 | ‚úÖ Good |
| Primary + Accent | 2.8 : 1 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Decorative Only |

**Primary Color**:

- Deep Violet `#6a11cb`
- Serves as the **core gradient** starting color, with strong visual recognition.
- Can be applied to navigation bars, core buttons, important headings, etc.
- Auxiliary values:
  - #5a0eb7 (hover state)
  - #7a24df (active state)

**Accent Color**:

- Vibrant Blue `#2575fc`
- Forms a perfect gradient transition with the **primary color**, providing visual focus.
- Can be applied to interactive elements, floating buttons, progress indicators.
- Auxiliary values:
  - #1c68e8 (hover state)
  - #3e86ff (active state)

**Core Gradient** transitions from Deep Purple `#6a11cb` to Vibrant Blue `#2575fc`, enhanced by **derived colors** for added depth.
